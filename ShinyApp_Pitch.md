=====================================================  

transition: rotate

Why is the ShinyApp "Basic Introduction to ggplot2" needed?
========================================================

- Non-intuitive syntax of `ggplot` R commands
- Basic capabilities of `ggplot` not widely known
- Options such as `colour` and `facet_wrap` mysterious to many

Who needs this ShinyApp?
========================================================

- Anyone who wants to start using `ggplot` but was hesitant to make the leap
- Anyone teaching others how to use `ggplot` who needs a handy interactive example
- Anyone interested to see power and flexibility of `ggplot`
- Anyone wishing to observe power of the `eval` command

```r
ggplot_command = sprintf("g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=%s, y=%s, colour=%s)) + facet_wrap(~%s) + geom_%s()",
input$x, input$y, input$colour, input$facet_wrap, input$geom)
eval(parse(text=ggplot_command))
```

Example Command and Plot Generated by the ShinyApp "Basic Introduction to ggplot2"
