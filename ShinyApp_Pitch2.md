Why is the ShinyApp - Basic Introduction to ggplot2 needed?
======

1. Non-intuitive syntax of ggplot R commands.
2. Basic capabilities of ggplot not widely known.
3. Options such as colour and facet_wrap mysterious to many.

Who needs this ShinyApp?
=====================
1. Anyone who wants to start using ggplot but was hesitant to make the leap.
2. Anyone teaching others how to use ggplot who needs a handy interactive example.
3. Anyone interested to see power and flexibility of ggplot.
4. Anyone wishing to observe power of the eval command.

ggplot_command = sprintf("g = ggplot(mpg, aes(x=%s, y=%s, colour=%s)) + facet_wrap(~%s) + geom_%s()",
input$x, input$y, input$colour, input$facet_wrap, input$geom)
eval(parse(text=ggplot_command))
